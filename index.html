## My first contribution to an R package

## My first contribution to an R package

0. Always on the look out for new features, avid reader of `NEWS` files

--

0. Browsed the GitHub repo (https://github.com/rmaia/pavo)
0. Noticed an open issue I knew how to solve

--

0. Contacted the devs ðŸ˜± and offered a PR 


    
???

- didn't know the etiquette
- was afraid they would be offended I told them their package is not perfect

--

Continued contributing and eventually became an official maintainer

--

Felt empowered and started working on other R packages

## How to facilitate this transition?

## How to make sure projects are not simply open-source but community projects?

## Many users think their feedback would not be valued

???

Twitter conversation: 
- ask how they feel after submitting an issue on GitHub

usual pattern:
something is broken/unclear -&gt; give up and move on

we want: 
something is broken/unclear -&gt; report the issue

This is what I want to address

# How to foster a community around your package

Tips to make it less scary, more rewarding to give feedback / contribute

Based on my experience -&gt; very subjective. Interested in discussing this
after.

Otherwise, we are running the risk of missing out on contributions

## Show that you are available and want to communicate

--

- If possible, allow to contact you through various platforms

--

- Share the recent changes (`NEWS.md`) of your package on these platforms

--

- Open issues with unresolved questions (possibly tag as `help-wanted`)

???

on some projects, noticed most feedback comes via email or twitter

engagement, feeling of a community

layout: true

## Don't let contributors work for nothing / feel ignored

---

- Acknowledge feedback:
  - with a quick (even short) answer
  - with a shout-out / addition to contributors later

---

- Acknowledge feedback

- Always push your recent work in the public repo (don't keep local branches)

---

- Acknowledge feedback

- Always push your recent work in the public repo (don't keep local branches)

- Share upcoming development (roadmap) of your package

## Reduce the workload

---

---

- Disable failing tests

- Disable unnecessary bots (e.g. coverage bot)

To be honest, still not sure how to read it today...

## But leave opportunities to learn

--

- Avoid using the 'Allow edits from maintainers' feature
